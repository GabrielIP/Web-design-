                <p>New York City and its surrounding areas have a rich
                skateboarding history. Although originating on the West coast,
                New York City quickly became one of the most sought after
                skateboarding locations. If your're new to the area there is a
                steep learning curve but this site aims to provide information
                for locals and visitors alike.</p>


                <p>This site will rank diffrent skateparks with a highly
                scientific method that I personally created. Taking into key
                factors of the skateparks the <i>skill</i> required,
                <i>condition</i> ,and <i>complexity</i> will be evaluated. The
                rating for the three cateregories are <strong>Nah</strong>,
                <strong>Meh</strong> and <strong>Dope</strong>.
                <strong>Nah</strong> is the lowest ranking, while
                <strong>Meh</strong> is chillin in the middle somewhere and
                <strong>Dope</strong> is the highest.</p>


                <p>Be sure to check out the skate spots on the right for some
                dope links with plenty of reviews pulled from yelp. All the
                skatepark banners have some steezy links with even more info as
                well.</p>

            <p>Hey guys! So I've been skateboarding the last 14 years and it
            has been a blast. Although I grew up skating in a street type
            environment I've switched to skateparks as to reduce the potential
            for injury. After living and skating across the country I'm hoping
            to provide information for other skaters. <img height="170" src=
